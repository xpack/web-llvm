## Description {#details}

A special type used by analysis passes to provide an address that identifies that particular analysis pass type.

Analysis passes should have a static data member of this type and derive from the <code><a href="/docs/api/structs/llvm/analysisinfomixin">AnalysisInfoMixin</a></code> to get a static <a href="/docs/api/namespaces/llvm/callingconv/#abdf8cf606905c10634e831390981b0ed">ID</a> method used to identify the analysis in the pass management infrastructure.
