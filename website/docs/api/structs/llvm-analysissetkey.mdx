## Description {#details}

A special type used to provide an address that identifies a set of related analyses.

These sets are primarily used below to mark sets of analyses as preserved.

For example, a transformation can indicate that it preserves the CFG of a function by preserving the appropriate <a href="/docs/api/structs/llvm/analysissetkey">AnalysisSetKey</a>. An analysis that depends only on the CFG can then check if that <a href="/docs/api/structs/llvm/analysissetkey">AnalysisSetKey</a> is preserved; if it is, the analysis knows that it itself is preserved.
